`steam-tradeoffers` is a library for Node.js and io.js written in JavaScript. It allows you to automate Steam trading using trade offers. It was designed with [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam) in mind, but does not depend on it directly. Some of the methods of the library are wrappers for Steam Web API.

__Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-tradeoffers/wiki/FAQ)__ first if you have any questions.

If your question is not answered here, please ask it in [https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum](https://github.com/steam-forward/node-steam-forum), __please do not open an issue here__. Issues are only for bugs and feature requests.

# Installation

```
npm install steam-tradeoffers
```

# Usage
Instantiate a SteamTradeOffers object...

```js
var SteamTradeOffers = require('steam-tradeoffers');
var offers = new SteamTradeOffers();
```

...then setup session and WebAPI key:

```js
offers.setup({
  sessionID: sessionID,
  webCookie: cookies,
  APIKey: webAPIKey
});
```

You can obtain session information with [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam) and its plugin [steam-weblogon](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-weblogon).

# Demo

A [demo bot](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049913045/) exists that also serves as a donation bot.

[Source code](https://gist.github.com/Alex7Kom/d764ef2925060c4e7c27) (based on the `storehouse.js` example).

# Examples

You'll need to install [node-steam](https://github.com/seishun/node-steam), [steam-weblogon](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-weblogon), and [steam-web-api-key](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-web-api-key) in order to run the examples.

The `storehouse.js` file contains an example of handling incoming trade offers.

The `offerbot.js` is an example of making a trade offer.

On first launch both of the examples will 'crash'. Check your email for Steam Guard code and edit an example file to add it, then run it again.

Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/Alex7Kom/node-steam-tradeoffers/wiki/FAQ) before creating an issue about examples.

# Methods

The first param for all methods is an object. The second param is callback. All callbacks supplied with `Error` as the first argument or `null` if no errors occured.

## setup(options[, callback])

As noted above, this method is used to setup a web session. If you want to operate with trade offers right after startup, do it in callback of this method.

Options:

* `sessionID` is a valid web session ID. In node-steam, you can use the `webSessionID` event to get it.
* `webCookie` is an array of cookies. In node-steam, you can use the `webLogOn` method to get it.
* `APIKey` is a Web API key for the account you use to trade. API key of another account won't work.

## loadMyInventory(options, callback)

Loads your inventory for the given app and context. For example, use 440 and 2 for TF2 and 570 and 2 for Dota 2. The second argument to `callback` will be an array of item objects in case of success.

Options:

* `appId` is the Steam AppID
* `contextId` is the inventory context Id
* `language` (optional) is the language for item descriptions
* `tradableOnly` (optional) is a boolean flag that defaults to `true` to return tradable items only

## loadPartnerInventory(options, callback)

Loads your partner inventory for the given app and context.

Options:

* `partnerSteamId` is the SteamID of the trade partner.  You need specify only `partnerAccountId` or `partnerSteamId`.
* `partnerAccountId` is the Steam Account ID of the trade partner. You need specify only `partnerAccountId` or `partnerSteamId`.
* `appId` is the Steam AppID
* `contextId` is the inventory context Id
* `tradeOfferId` (optional) is needed to load private inventory of the trade partner for received trade offer
* `language` (optional) is the language for item descriptions

## makeOffer(options[, callback])

Makes a trade offer to the partner.

Options:

* `partnerAccountId` or `partnerSteamId`, you need only one of those.
* `accessToken` (optional) is a token from the public Trade URL of the partner.
* `itemsFromMe` are the items you will lose in the trade.
* `itemsFromThem` are the items you will receive in the trade.
* `counteredTradeOffer` (optional) is the ID to a trade offer you are countering.
* `message` (optional) is a message to include in the offer.

`itemsFromMe` and `itemsFromThem` both are arrays of item objects that look like this:

```json
{
    "appid": 440,
    "contextid": 2,
    "amount": 1,
    "assetid": "1627590398"
}
```

If success the second param to `callback` will be an object with `tradeofferid` of the newly created trade offer.

## getOffers(options, callback)
## getOffer(options, callback)

The first method loads a list of trade offers, and the second loads just a single offer.

Options:

* See [Steam Web API/IEconService](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API/IEconService).

 The second argument to `callback` will be an object that Steam Web API returns. The only thing to note is that the wrapper adds a property `steamid_other` with the SteamID of the trade partner to each `CEcon_TradeOffer` object in received trades.

## declineOffer(options[, callback])
## acceptOffer(options[, callback])
## cancelOffer(options[, callback])

`declineOffer` or `acceptOffer` that was sent to you. `cancelOffer` that you sent.

Options:

* `tradeOfferId` is a trade offer Id

The second argument to `callback` will be an object with response from Steam, but don't expect anything meaningful in it.

## getOfferToken(callback)

The second argument to `callback` will be the offer token of the bot, extracted from its trade offer URL.

## getItems(options, callback)

Options:

* `tradeId` is the ID of the completed trade you want to get items for, available as a `tradeid` property on offers from `getOffers` or `getOffer`

The second argument to `callback` will be an array of items acquired in a completed trade.

## getHoldDuration(options, callback)

Get escrow hold duration for yourself and your trade partner.

Options:

* `partnerAccountId` or `partnerSteamId`, you need only one of those.
* `accessToken` (optional) is a token from the public Trade URL of the partner.

The second argument to `callback` will be an object like:

```js
{ my: 0, their: 0 }
```
